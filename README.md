# AI for Occupancy Management - Building AI course project

Final project for the Building AI course

## Summary

he AI will initially be deployed at the municipal level to identify bottlenecks in the allocation of accommodations to foreign specialists and refugees, so as to distribute them according to the needs of the municipalities and the requirements of the foreign specialists and refugees.


## Background

In Germany, there is a shortage of about 550,000 positions in the public sector, leading to a massive shortage of skilled workers in administration, especially at the municipal level. Simultaneously, municipalities face the challenge of housing foreign specialists and refugees in their care facilities and integrating them appropriately. The current distribution key is not very transparent and leads to the overloading of municipalities and dissatisfaction among foreign specialists and refugees. Individual needs, ethnic differences, and relevant expertise can no longer be adequately considered due to the massive bureaucratic process and shortage of skilled workers. Additionally, family members of foreign specialists and refugees may already be living in Germany, which must also be taken into account. Furthermore, conflicts often arise between ethnicities as cultural differences are not sufficiently considered. Integration often fails due to the formation of cliques and isolation of individual ethnic groups.


## How is it used?

By matching the workload and occupancy rates, as well as the need for skilled workers and any already residing family members with the résumés of foreign specialists and refugees, they can be distributed and integrated much more efficiently and satisfactorily for all parties involved. Overloading of municipalities and administration can thus be countered even before admission. Additionally, foreign specialists and refugees can bring their professional experience to where it is actually needed, allowing integration to proceed much more efficiently, smoothly, and quickly. Considering ethnic backgrounds can not only avoid ethnic conflicts but also promote diversity and integration. By mixing foreign specialists and refugees from different cultures, it becomes more difficult for them to isolate within their own culture, and integration and collaboration can be promoted through mutual support. AI can also connect "older" foreign specialists and refugees with new ones in a mentorship program to further promote integration and facilitate entry into the new culture, language, and professional life.

Benefits:
* Resource Optimization: By efficiently managing the occupancy of foreign specialists and refugees, municipalities can optimize their resources, ensuring that available housing and services are used effectively and reducing wastage.
* Tailored Integration Programs: AI can help design tailored integration programs by analyzing the backgrounds, skills, and needs of the individuals, making the integration process more effective and personalized.
* Proactive Problem Solving: AI can predict potential issues such as overcrowding, cultural clashes, or skill mismatches, allowing municipalities to proactively address these challenges before they escalate.
* Enhanced Data Collection: The system can improve data collection and accuracy, providing valuable insights for policy makers to make informed decisions regarding immigration and integration policies.

## Data sources and AI methods

Initially, municipalities and accommodation facilities need to be clustered using unsupervised learning, as well as the incoming foreign specialists and refugees. Subsequently, workloads, occupancy rates, and the demand for skilled workers in the municipalities (nurses, doctors, engineers, etc.) must be determined. At the same time, the personal data, ethnic backgrounds, educational and professional training, and experience of the foreign specialists and refugees need to be recorded.

Additional Data Sources:
* Health and Wellbeing Indicators: Integrating health and wellbeing data can ensure that the physical and mental health needs of foreign specialists and refugees are met, facilitating better overall integration.
* Employment Opportunities: Linking with local job markets and employment agencies can help match foreign specialists with job opportunities that suit their skills and qualifications.
* Educational Institutions: Collaboration with local schools, vocational training centers, and universities can help address educational needs and provide pathways for further education and skill development.

## Challenges

It does not solve the shortage of skilled workers in the public sector nor the challenge of integrating foreign specialists and refugees. It also does not address challenges in the event of nationwide overloading of occupancy management due to a lack of accommodation capacity.

Implementation Considerations:
* Ethical and Privacy Concerns: Ensuring that the data collected and used by the AI system is handled ethically and securely, with strict adherence to privacy laws and regulations.
* Stakeholder Engagement: Involving local communities, foreign specialists, refugees, and other stakeholders in the design and implementation of the system to ensure it meets their needs and gains their support.
* Training and Support: Providing training and support for municipal staff to effectively use the AI system and understand its outputs, fostering a smooth integration into existing processes.

## What next?

It can be scaled from the municipal to the federal and state levels, as well as Europe-wide, to ensure adequate, Europe-wide distribution and relieve individual countries.

Potential Partnerships:
* Technology Companies: Partnering with tech companies that specialize in AI and data analytics can provide the technical expertise needed to develop and maintain the system.
* Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs): Collaborating with NGOs that work with migrants and refugees can offer valuable insights and support in addressing the unique challenges faced by these groups.
* International Organizations: Engaging with international organizations such as the United Nations or the European Union can provide additional resources and support for scaling the system.

Future Research and Development:
* Continuous Improvement: Regularly updating and refining the AI algorithms based on feedback and new data to improve accuracy and effectiveness over time.
* Cross-Cultural Studies: Conducting research on the impact of cultural differences on integration and how AI can better address these factors.
* Scalability: Exploring ways to scale the system to handle larger volumes of data and more complex scenarios as the number of foreign specialists and refugees grows.
